# ProjectX - A Full-stack Next.js App

> A modern, full-stack web application built with **Next.js App Router**, **React Query**, **Express**, and **MongoDB** ‚Äì designed with performance, scalability, and developer experience in mind.

## Overview

An AI-driven full-stack SaasS for project management built using Next.js, Typescript, React.js, ShadCN, Node.js, enabling efficient issue tracking, task assignment, and real-time status updates with a user-friendly interface

This project was built to showcase architecture choices, cutting-edge full-stack development using modern generative AI models. It uses frontier LLM models for priority assessment and workflow optimization by analyzing task urgency and importance, providing intelligent recommendations for prioritization

- TypeScript
- Shadcn UI / Radix UI

**Backend üõ†Ô∏è**

- Node.js + Hono.js
- Appwrite for DB and auth
- REST APIs using Next.js's full-stack capabilities
- OAuth

## üß† Key Features

- ‚öôÔ∏è Full authentication flow with email/password and OAuth login using Gmail and Github
- üß† Server-side session fetching via `cookies()` API (Next.js)
- üåê Clean API separation using Hono.js for creating Express.js like modular api endpoints
- üì¶ Responsive UI with reusable components
- üö® Global error boundary and alert system
- üîÑ Optimistic UI & error handling via React Query
- üîç Accessible, semantic HTML with consistent design system

## üß™ Running Locally

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/projectx.git
cd projectx
```

### 2. Set up environment variables

Create `.env.local` in the root of the project and add following env vars

| Parameter                               | Description                                       |
| :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`                   | **Required**. Needed for making backend api calls |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT`         | **Required**. Appwrite api endpoint               |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT`          | **Required**. Appwrite project id                 |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID`      | **Required**. Database id                         |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_WORKSPACES_ID`    | **Required**. Workspaces collection id            |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_IMAGES_BUCKET_ID` | **Required**. Images storage bucket id            |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_MEMBERS_ID`       | **Required**. Members collection id               |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECTS_ID`      | **Required**. Projects collection id              |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_TASKS_ID`         | **Required**. Tasks collection id                 |
| `NEXT_APPWRITE_KEY`                     | **Required**. Your Appwrite API key               |

### 3. Install packages

```
npm install
```

You might face dependency issues while installing packages because ShadCN is not fully compatible with React 19 (the version used in this app). But we don't use any such incompatible components from ShadCN. So you can safely use the following command to install packages.

```
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 4. Start the app

```bash
npm run dev # Start app in dev mode
```

OR

```bash
npm run build # Build app for production
npm run start # Start app in production mode
```

App runs at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
